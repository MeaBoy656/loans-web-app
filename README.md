Hello🙂

# Welcome to the "Loans Web App" project #

Thanks for stopping by.

This project is a project I did as a freelancer. A new startup that today is called "Sagole Finance Profile Analysis Ltd." ask me to design and develop the interface of their service in one week only (MVP). The service is an artificial intelligence algorithm that provide recommendations for loans. Meant for bankers who need to decide who they are giving loans to. In this project I worked with a backend engineer, fullstack developer, and data engineer.

Technologies: React.js, Javascript, CSS, Gsap (Greensock Animation Library).

# ------------ IMPORTANT --------------- #

The interface is written in Hebrew. I am sorry in advance if you can't understand it.

# Notes #

- Commits history is not visible since the original repository is contained in a different repository.
- Because their algorithms is private, I can only share the interface itself, so no server requests are made here.
